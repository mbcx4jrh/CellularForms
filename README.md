# CellularForms
 
 An exploration of simulated cellular growth first (i think) [described by Andy Lomas](https://andylomas.com/cellularForms.html)

 Nods also to work by:  
[Michael Fogleman](https://www.michaelfogleman.com/projects/cellular-forms/)  
[Sage Jenson](https://www.sagejenson.com/digital-morphologies)  
  
This is early days in the project and after prototyping I am building up a toolset to explore what can be created (as well as learning Go at the same time)
